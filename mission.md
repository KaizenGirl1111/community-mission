## My mission is encapsulated in a motto-
**Motto-** Women in STEAM promote more women in STEAM. 

(My community is an all women college)

**Mission described-**
We often encounter the Queen Bee problem where a woman acts like a Queen Bee, treats other women in her university/workplace as worker bees and never lets anyone get ahead of her. 
My community will change this. I will build a culture where seniors mentor junior women. I'll encourage women of my college to give back to the community by organising hackathons etc.
